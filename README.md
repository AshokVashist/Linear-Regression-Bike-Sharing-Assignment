## Problem Statement
- A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic. The company is finding it very difficult to sustain in the current market scenario.So they decided to go with data based analysis approach to figure out what is impacting Shared Bike Demands.
- We have received a Survey data which covers a lots of informations about the Bike Sharing Deamnd and associated factors across US
 
##Business Objective
    - Model building and Evaluation on Survey Data
    - Analyse the factors influencing the Bike Sharing demand 
    - Business would leverage this Model to estimate Future Demands

## Factors influencing Bike Sharing Demand:
- Season : ‘Spring’, ‘Summer’ & ‘Winter’ has negative corelation  with BikeSharing demand, it indicates that these season have low demand of Bike sharing.
- Month : ‘January’ month is having negative coefficient; it indicates that Bike Sharing demand decreases during Jan month where ‘September’ month is having positive coefficient and have maximum demand of Bike sharing.
- Weather Situation : ‘Light Snow with rain’ and ‘Mist’ weather having negative coefficient which indicates bike sharing demands decreases during these weather conditions.

## Conclusion
Linear regression model is  able to predict bike demand precisely with an R2 Score of more than 79%
